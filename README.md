<h4>The accuracy graph above illustrates the performance of each classification model on the dataset. It shows how well each model classified the employees based on specific features. The y-axis represents the accuracy scores, while the x-axis displays the different models we tested. The graph provides a clear comparison of the models, helping us determine the best one for this particular dataset.

Conclusively, we selected the most accurate model and used it to classify the employees effectively based on their job titles, departments, and employment status. The results and insights from this project can be valuable for understanding workforce diversity, government salary analysis, and related topics</h4>
